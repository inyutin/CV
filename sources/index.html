            <h2>Summary of Qualifications</h2>
            <div class="line"></div>
            <p style="margin-top: 20;">
                <b>Python</b> is the language I know best, <b>2+ years</b> of experience. I'm proficient in <b>aiolibs</b>, <br>
                developed several production services with <b>aiohttp</b> and <b>aiopg</b>. <br>
                For my pet-projects I used <b>Flask</b> and <b>SQLAlchemy</b>. Big fan of <b>mypy</b>. <br>
            </p>
            <p style="margin-top: 20;">
                I use <b>Go</b> for the half of a year. I developed a production application that communicates by <b>gRPC</b>. <br>
                This application works with raw <b>Linux</b> signals, so I learned a lot about internal Go packages. 
            </p>
            <p style="margin-top: 20;">
                Just to mention, I work with <b>Docker</b> for my pet-projects. As for databases I use <b>PostgreSQL</b> or <b>MongoDB</b>.

            <h3>Aiohttp-retry</h3>
            <p>Simple retry client over aiohttp. This package is available on PyPi.</p>

            <h3>CASPaxos</h3>
            <p>
                CASPaxos is a distributed register without a log. <br>
                The main idea of CASPaxos is an attempt to replicate the state of the register, not the log.
                I wanted to figure out how it works and wrote my little implementation.
            </p>

            <h3>ViBoard</h3>
            <p>
                The project that grew out from hackathon. It was a video service where all the data was stored distributed on the IPFS network. 
                We tried to build a community based economy. Every day  a certain number of new coins, which were <br> 
                distributed to the most active users in a day, appeared. We supposed coins cost would be ensured by the popularity <br>
                of the platform, but the project didn't take off.
            </p>

            <h3>TinyFileSystem</h3>
            <p>
                Toy file system model. All the information is stored in one file and access is provided through a special interface.<br>
                I have implemented all the basic commands for working with directories and files.
