            <p>
                CASPaxos is a distributed register without a log. <br>
                The main idea of CASPaxos is an attempt to replicate the state of the register, not the log.
                I wanted to figure out how it works and wrote my little implementation.

            <p>
                The project that grew out of hackathon. It was a video service where all the data was stored distributed on the IPFS network. <br>
                We tried to build a community based economy. Every day  a certain number of new coins, which were distributed to the most active users in a day, appeared. <br>
                We supposed coins cost would to be ensured by the popularity of the platform, but the project didn't took off. <br>
